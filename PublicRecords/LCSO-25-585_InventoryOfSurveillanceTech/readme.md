## Request 
To Whom It May Concern:

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

Timeframe: January 1, 2019 to the present. If a different start date will materially expedite production, please advise.

Scope:
I request records sufficient to identify all surveillance technologies, products, and services acquired, licensed, or subscribed to by Lane County, including the Lane County Sheriff's Office (LCSO), or acquired by other County departments on LCSO’s behalf, whether funded by County funds or grants.

Definitions:
Surveillance technology: Any device, system, software, or service primarily used to monitor, collect, analyze, or share information about individuals, vehicles, or their activities. This includes fixed or mobile systems, cloud services, analytics, and data-sharing platforms.
Examples (non-exhaustive):
- Automated license plate readers (ALPR) and related analytics;
- Fixed CCTV and video management systems; vehicle/in-car and body-worn cameras and any automated analysis modules (e.g., object/face/weapon detection, transcription);
- Drones/UAS and payloads; pole or trailer-mounted cameras; mobile surveillance platforms;
- Facial recognition or other biometric systems (fingerprint/AFIS, iris, voice); image/video analytics; “real-time crime center” platforms;
- Audio/acoustic systems (e.g., gunshot detection) and other sensor networks;
- Social media monitoring/OSINT tools; web scraping; keyword/geo-fencing analytics;
- Cell-site simulators and related tooling; device location tracking services; forensic extraction/analysis tools (e.g., mobile device/computer forensics);
- Data broker and investigative intelligence subscriptions (e.g., commercial person-locator, vehicle, or identity data); information-sharing systems with external agencies; portals that aggregate criminal justice data.
Exclusions (to narrow burden): Routine office IT and productivity tools (e.g., email, word processing, endpoint antivirus) are excluded unless they include surveillance-specific modules or analytics used as described above.

Scope:
1) Technology and software inventories
1.1) Any current or historical inventories, registries, or lists that identify LCSO’s hardware, software, platforms, or cloud services, including:
- Software/subscription inventories or SaaS/license lists;
- Fixed-asset registers for surveillance or public safety equipment;
- Camera registries or maps (fixed, mobile, trailer-mounted, or vendor-hosted);
- “System of record” or application portfolio lists maintained by LCSO or County IT.
1.2) For each entry, please include, where maintained: system name, vendor, product/module, deployment dates, quantity, status (active/inactive), data types collected, internal owner/custodian, and funding source. Preferred format: CSV/Excel.

2) Policies and inventories prepared for oversight that describe surveillance-related systems including:
- Technology inventories
- “Surveillance impact reports”
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data protection impact assessments (DPIA)
- Data governance catalogs
- CJIS system listings

Custodians and forwarding:
- This request likely involves LCSO, County IT, County Procurement/Purchasing (contracts, POs, and vendor payments), and the District Attorney (agreements and data-sharing).
- If LCSO does not hold all records, please forward this request to the appropriate custodians and advise.

Search guidance (not limiting):
- Keywords in descriptions or titles: “surveillance,” “ALPR,” “license plate,” “Flock,” “Vigilant,” “Genetec,” “Milestone,” “BriefCam,” “Veritone,” “ZeroEyes,” “ShotSpotter/SoundThinking,” “drone/UAS,” “facial recognition,” “biometric,” “AFIS,” “cell-site simulator,” “Cellebrite,” “GrayKey,” “OSINT,” “social media monitoring,” “databroker,” “LexisNexis Accurint,” “CLEAR,” “Thomson Reuters,” “Babel Street,” “Dataminr,” “Voyager,” “PredPol/Geolitica,” “Banjo,” “Palantir,” “WatchGuard,” “Axon,” “Genetec Clearance,” “evidence.com,” “real-time crime center,” “situational awareness,” “acoustic,” “gunshot,” “forensic,” “extraction.”
- Systems likely to contain responsive records: contract register, procurement/PO system, accounts payable/vendor payments, IT asset and software inventory systems.

Preferred Format:
- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download.
- Lists and ledgers in CSV/Excel.
- Contracts and documents in searchable PDF.

Fee Waiver Request:
I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by enabling oversight of surveillance technology use and their public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and will make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Lane County. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.

If any portions are withheld or redacted, please produce all segregable nonexempt material and cite the specific statutory basis for each withholding. If no records exist for a category, please say so.

If any part of this request is considered overly broad, please contact me to discuss reasonable narrowing.

Please contact me if you have questions

Sincerely,

Seth May
