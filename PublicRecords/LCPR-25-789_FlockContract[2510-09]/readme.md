## Request 
To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

I am seeking documents for any current contracts or agreement that Lane County has with Flock Safety. These records will most likely be from no earlier than Jan 1, 2025. I would prefer to receive digital copies of the documents, if available. 

Sincerely,
Seth May
