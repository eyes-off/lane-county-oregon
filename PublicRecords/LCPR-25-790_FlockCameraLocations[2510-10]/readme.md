To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

I am seeking documents that provide a list of the current or planned installation locations of Flock Safety cameras (automated license plate readers (ALPR)) within Lane County. I would prefer to receive digital copies of the documents, if available.
